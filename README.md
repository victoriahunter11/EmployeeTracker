In this assignment, I created an Employee Tracker through a contact management system for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. This tracker allows a user to add a department, role, and employee. It also allows them to view the content by their departments, roles, employees, and managers. An extra feature added was being able to delete employees. When adding a role, the department ID must already exist, which is important to note for testing.
